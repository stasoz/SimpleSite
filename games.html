Aim: To describe and define groups of words

You can use this describing game to help students practice or revise categories of words such as adjectives, jobs, animals, sports, etc. You can also use it to revise any vocabulary you have been teaching your students.

Procedure

Divide the students into pairs (A and B).

Each student will need a pen and a piece of paper.

Have all the A students move their chairs so they can’t see the board.

All B students should sit so they can see the board.

Write five to ten words on the board that you want the students to practice or revise. For example, if you wanted to revise sports you might write tennis, football, cycling, badminton, volleyball, etc.

Student B describes the first word on the board to Student A without saying the word, and speaking only in English, e.g. People play this sport on a court. They use a racket and ball to play. This sport is usually played between two people, etc.

Student A listens and then writes down the word he/she thinks it is and shows it to Student B.

Student A is not allowed to speak during the game. He/she can only write down the words on the paper.

If the word is correct, Student B moves onto describe the second word on the board and so on.

If it’s wrong, Student B must try to give a clearer definition or clue to help their partner guess the word.

When they have finished, the students swap roles and a new set of words is written on the board.
